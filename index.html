        <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a normal middle-class boy with a keen interest in computers and new technologies. I have gained knowledge about technologies and devices from news and YouTube videos. After completing my schooling, I pursued B.C.A to fulfill my dream of working in a technology-based software company. It has always been my aspiration to work in a software company, and I have researched companies in Chennai to understand their work and projects. Through social media, I discovered an opportunity at my dream company, and now I am eagerly awaiting your decision. Regardless of the outcome, I promise to do my best and continue learning from your team.</p>
